# Enemy Hanging Issue Fixes

## Problem Description
The enemy characters in the desktop pet application were sometimes hanging on screen and stopping movement, even when force cleanup was attempted.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Timer Management Issues
- **Problem**: Multiple timers (`followTimer`, `horrorEffectTimer`, `animationTimer`) could become null or stop working
- **Impact**: Enemies would stop moving or animating
- **Fix**: Enhanced timer initialization with exception handling and automatic restart

### 2. Exception Handling in Timer Callbacks
- **Problem**: Exceptions in timer callbacks would cause timers to stop permanently
- **Impact**: Enemies would freeze in place
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks with timer restart logic

### 3. Resource Exhaustion
- **Problem**: Multiple timers running simultaneously could cause performance issues
- **Impact**: System slowdown and potential hanging
- **Fix**: Better resource management and cleanup

### 4. Window State Issues
- **Problem**: Enemies could become invisible or disposed but remain in the list
- **Impact**: Ghost enemies that couldn't be cleaned up
- **Fix**: Enhanced cleanup logic with multiple detection methods

### 5. Concurrent Modification
- **Problem**: Enemy list modifications from multiple timer callbacks
- **Impact**: `ConcurrentModificationException` causing timer failures
- **Fix**: Thread-safe operations and proper synchronization

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Timer Management
```java
// Added exception handling and automatic restart for all timers
private void startFollowing() {
    try {
        if (followTimer != null) {
            followTimer.stop();
        }
        followTimer = new Timer(100, e -> {
            try {
                followPet();
            } catch (Exception ex) {
                System.out.println("Error in followPet timer: " + ex.getMessage());
                if (followTimer != null) {
                    followTimer.restart();
                }
            }
        });
        followTimer.start();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("Error starting follow timer: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

### 2. Health Monitoring System
```java
// New method to check enemy health and restart failed timers
private void checkEnemyHealth() {
    for (EnemyWindow enemy : enemies) {
        if (enemy.hasNullTimers() || enemy.isStuck()) {
            enemy.restartTimers();
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Recovery-Focused System
- **Less frequent checks**: Every 30 seconds instead of 8 seconds
- **Recovery-first approach**: Tries to fix issues before removing enemies
- **Only remove completely broken enemies**: 
  - Null timers for 5+ minutes
  - Completely disposed windows
  - Severely invalid locations
- **Multiple recovery attempts**: Gives enemies multiple chances to recover
- **Prolonged failure detection**: Only removes enemies that have been non-functional for a very long time

### 4. Movement Validation
```java
// Added location validation before movement
private boolean isValidLocation(Point location) {
    return location != null && 
           location.x > -10000 && location.x < 10000 && 
           location.y > -10000 && location.y < 10000;
}
```

### 5. Emergency Cleanup Methods
- **`forceRemoveAllEnemies()`**: Enhanced with automatic restart
- **`emergencyCleanupHangingEnemies()`**: New method for severe cases
- **Automatic recovery**: System restarts after cleanup if enabled

## New Methods Added

### EnemyWindow Class
- `isStuck()`: Detects only truly problematic cases (exact same position for very long time)
- `restartTimers()`: Restarts all timers for recovery
- `hasBeenRunningTooLong()`: Prevents memory leaks (5+ minutes)
- `hasBeenCompletelyBrokenForTooLong()`: Only removes after 5+ minutes of being non-functional
- `isValidLocation()`: Validates movement locations

### AdvancedDesktopPet Class
- `checkEnemyHealth()`: Recovery-focused health monitoring
- `cleanupOnlyBrokenEnemies()`: Only removes completely broken enemies
- `emergencyCleanupHangingEnemies()`: Severe cleanup method

## Testing Instructions

1. **Run the application**: Use `test_enemy_fixes.bat` or run directly
2. **Enable enemy system**: Use the settings window
3. **Monitor behavior**: Watch for hanging enemies
4. **Test cleanup**: Use the "Force Cleanup" button in settings
5. **Check console**: Look for error messages and cleanup logs

## Expected Improvements

1. **Reduced hanging**: Enemies should recover automatically from most issues
2. **Better cleanup**: More aggressive detection and removal of stuck enemies
3. **Automatic recovery**: Failed timers restart automatically
4. **Memory management**: Enemies are removed before causing memory leaks
5. **Emergency options**: Multiple cleanup methods for different scenarios

## Monitoring

The application now provides detailed console output for:
- Timer errors and restarts
- Enemy health checks
- Cleanup operations
- Recovery attempts

Watch the console output to see the system working and identify any remaining issues.

## Troubleshooting

If enemies still hang:
1. Use the "Force Cleanup" button in settings
2. Check console for error messages
3. Restart the application if needed
4. Report specific error messages for further debugging
